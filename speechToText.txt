use a speech to text api

api writes what it can listen to

after the lec,
the user makes neccessary changes in the file as many typing errors might be there.
the user gives name to the notes chp etc
and saves it

we can try to give formatting but that must be tested first as it will be ai controlled formatting

extra features:
pause recording.

edit while speech to text is active.
the screen will show what the speech to text is writing.
which is editable immediately

new paragraph button:
sends the cursor to new paragraph

new notes button:
saves and closes this note and opens another one

highlighter tool

text formatting features which are present in html such as bold, monospace ,etc

comments :

auto new line
the ai will put a new line everytime it does not hear anything for more than 3 seconds

[Super Extra Feature ( only if time is there)]
ai will save a audio clip of the word it did not understand 
so that the user can replay the clip and understand what word to input in place of the wrong word
